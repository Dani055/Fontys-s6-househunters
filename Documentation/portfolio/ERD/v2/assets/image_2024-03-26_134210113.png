There was a choice to be made whether comments should get their own microservice and database, however I decided against it. The reason being is that it would be doing more of the same thing, since the bids already have their own microservice and database. The proof of concept is there and I felt it is unneeded to achieve the learning outcome of distributed data.</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBLzRhQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8d21d346307d803e1f72fd862c8f503e6214e54b/image_2024-03-26_134538444.png" data-key="w1m5w72n1obfoc2h4i4szi65eboo"><br></p><hr><p>Finally, the ListingFragment and bid are in the 3rd database and managed by the bid microservice. The reason for having a ListingFragment is to decouple the bid and listing microservice, so that a direct connection between them is not needed when placing a bid. The listing fragment contains only the most crucial information of a listing, which is required when placing a bid.</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBd0ViQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1b071824635d7fbb9333b3732ae30576ecba56b0/image_2024-03-26_134708201.png" data-key="j5m22twx9v3si63n0jxjlm5s4yo1"></p> </body> </html>
