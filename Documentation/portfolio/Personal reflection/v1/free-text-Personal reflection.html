<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h3><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">Personal reflection</span></h3><p><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">I feel like I have greatly grown during this semester in both a technical and a professional aspect. I've learned many things that will help me with my future as a young software developer, who applies their skills in an authentic work field.</span></p><p><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">Firstly, my technical knowledge has vastly expanded this semester. I learned how to plan, build, develop and test scalable architecture by applying many industry practices like distributed data, microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, DevOps, etc. This was achieved both through my own research, but also through the help of the technical teachers. Their feedback was always invaluable and clear while also setting me on the right path and giving me directions on where to apply myself. Taking a SCRUM-based approach with my individual project meant that I was always working in sprints, planning my next tasks and receiving feedback through retrospectives and feedback sessions. Afterwards, I used those retrospectives to plan my way forwards to achieving proficiency on the technical learning outcomes.</span></p><p><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">Furthermore, my professional and leadership skills have greatly improved. I've worked on many crucial soft-skills like teamwork, collaboration, communication, professionalism and leadership in both a personal and a group aspect. This was achieved through applying SCRUM to our group project and being a SCRUM master, where I got to communicate with our clients, plan and create tasks, lead meetings and retrospectives. My teammates also helped me improve through peer feedback which was held at the end of each sprint. My semester coach/group teacher was also regularly present at meetings, where my team and I applied her feedback in order to achieve better results and improve our skills as a group.</span></p><p><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">Personal leadership was also very important this semester. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without it. I needed to be my own compass most of the time and actively seek out my teachers for feedback that I can apply to my project and my way of working. I also needed to seek my own improvement in a personal aspect that is unrelated to the semester's expectations, since I had some genuine interests that, even while not covered by learning outcomes, were important for my own personal development (deploying my application to cloud, exploring chaos engineering, to name a few).</span></p><p><br><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36)">Overall, this semester was full of challenges that helped my grow as an individual. This includes semester expectations such as technical aspects, professionalism and personal leadership, as well as personal interests that fell outside the scope of the learning outcomes.</span></p> </body> </html>
