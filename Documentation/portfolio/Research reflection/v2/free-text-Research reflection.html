<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>During this semester a lot of research was carried out in both an individual and group aspect. The group research, along with the questions I specifically answered is in the <span data-type="mention" data-id="438054" data-label="Research report (group)" data-mention-type="evidence">@Research report (group)</span> , where our team neeeded to figure out the best way to track and visualise system operation. The research included many different methods from library/field/lab/workshop and I'm quite happy with how it turned out, especially since the client was also, in the end, satisfied with our results.</p><p>A place where I could have done better, though, is the individual research. At the time, when I was doing the research plan, it was unknown to me that the research needs to be specifically focused on concrete problem and needs to come to clear conclusions. As a result, my research report ended up being more broad in a sense that there was a lot of library research about how message brokers are implemented in a enterprise solution, afterwards field and lab was explored to see how they can be applied in my project.</p><p>However, in terms of results, I must say that the research was incredibly helpful with moving my project forward. Without this research I wouldn't have been able to implement a crucial part of my individual project. Moreover, seeing how in the beginning of the semester, the ways to create enterprise solutions were unclear to me, a lot of broader library research needed to be carried out in order to get a better understanding of the problem. As Nicole noted, graduation research needs to be a lot more focused on the specific project, with field research, combining library and workshop to get an answer to the question. Afterwards, lab/showroom can be used to validate the research in the end.</p><p>Looking back on my individual research, the first few questions could have been more specific to it. For example, the main research question could have been "How can HouseHunters become a de-coupled enterprise solution", where the context of the project can be explored through field research, and with the addition of library methods, a solution can be found, which can be tested through lab/showroom. However, an argument can also be made that when I was creating this research there was no context to explore yet, as the project had barely any implementation, so perhaps a another topic all-together could have been better in the first place, which is something I will definitely keep in mind for graduation.</p> </body> </html>
