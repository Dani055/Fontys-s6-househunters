<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>During this semester for both projects I follow the SCRUM framework in order to achieve the best outcomes and prove my professional standard.</p><h2>Group project</h2><p>The group project is structured in a way where every 2 weeks there is a meeting between the group and the clients where a sprint retrospective is held. All class teachers (Marcel, Qin, Nicole) are invited to the meetings and are free to join them.</p><p>In total, there are 8 CY2 sprints with the last one ending on the 20th June, where it will be held in the client's office in 's-Hertogenbosch. Notice that I mentioned CY2 sprints. This is because CY2 sprints differ from the sprints defined by Fontys, which are 6 in total (Sprint 0 - Sprint 5) and are 3 weeks long, rather than 2. In this scenario, all work (even mid-sprint work) is handed in to Fontys for the respective sprint delivery assignments</p><p><strong>Scrum master</strong></p><p>Every sprint a new SCRUM master is chosen in order to give everyone the opportunity to develop their leadership skills and lead the rest of the people in the group. Each SCRUM master has the responsibility of prioritizing GitHub issues/user stories and communicating with the clients. The SCRUM master for the respective sprint can be seen in the feedpulse tab, where they submit the feedback on how the group is/has done during that time. The order of SCRUM masters is as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Tudor Morar</p></li><li><p>Yordan Doykov (me)</p></li><li><p>Nikolay Valchanov</p></li><li><p>Kiril Katsarski</p></li></ol><p>After all groups members have had a sprint as a SCRUM master, we start again from the beginning with Tudor.</p><p><strong>Teacher feedback</strong><br>At the end of each sprint a feedback session is held with Nicole (if necessary) to determine if there are any things blocking us or if there are any uncertainties. The group always tries to ask for her feedback, especially if there are research-related deliverables (such as the research plan and report). Every sprint there is also a group feedpulse created so that the feedback received can be noted down along with the group's performance, which can be used to identify opportunities for improvement on collaboration and communication.</p><p><strong>Peer feedback</strong><br>At the end of each sprint a peer feedback is held where group members evaluate each other's performance anonymously through feedpulse. This is done to convey any problems/opportunities to the group anonymously, while the team members also get feedback on their work which they can use to improve their personal skills and professional standards for the future sprints.</p><p><strong>Meeting minutes</strong></p><p>Every meeting that is held with the clients has a minute taker. The minute taker in question is the person who was SCRUM master in the last sprint. This is done in order to make sure after the meeting everything is written down and there are no misunderstandings or forgotten details.</p><p><strong>GitHub issues</strong></p><p>In order to conform to the SCRUM standard, issues are created each sprint by the clients and team members and are prioritized by the scrum masters. These issues can be found in GitHub (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/orgs/CY2Project/projects/1/views/1">https://github.com/orgs/CY2Project/projects/1/views/1</a>)<br><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBL1BEQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c56ac6646dbb8142013a29d23a3116587e66fc50/image_2024-05-27_173327099.png" data-key="di9gekuko59591sk228k0dsjipwv"></p><hr><h2>Individual project</h2><p>My individual project this semester also follows a SCRUM-derived approach. Work on the project is separated in 5 sprints (Sprint 1 - Sprint 5) where each sprint is 3 weeks long. Unlike the group project, there is no team, so for each sprint I am the SCRUM master that prioritizes what to do and how to prove my proficiency towards the learning outcomes.</p><p><strong>Teacher feedback</strong><br>At the end of each sprint I conduct a thorough feedback session with my technical teachers (Marcel, Qin, depending on who is available at the time). I usually try to gather equal amount of feedback from both. The feedback derived from them is then used to create the issues I need to work on for the next sprint. The feedback that I receive from my technical teachers can be found in feedpulse.</p><p><strong>Work planning</strong></p><p>The work planning for each sprint is defined in the sprint deliveries for the individual project, which can be found in canvas' respective assignments. The work planned is derived from the feedback of the teachers before and after sprint delivery.</p> </body> </html>
