<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1><strong><span style="color: rgb(63, 81, 181)">Introduction</span></strong></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">My name is Yordan and this is my 6th semester at Fontys. I am a passion-driven developer who puts extra effort into software quality. The one piece that is missing though, is my ability to develop enterprise software. During my internship in the last semester I learned a lot about working with a real team and a project that is actively used. However, that project did not have a large user base and was nowhere close to enterprise. So in short, in this semester I am hoping to learn the details of how enterprise software is structured and how I can make a small example of one myself.</span></p><h1><strong><span style="color: rgb(63, 81, 181)">Projects this semester</span></strong></h1><h3><strong><span style="color: rgb(103, 58, 183)">Individual project: HouseHunters</span></strong></h3><p>The individual project I worked on this semester is called HouseHunters. It’s a project related to real estate, where both owners and real estate agencies can list properties they want to sell. After the listing goes live, people can bid on the property. Once the bidding period is over, the highest bidder has the right to buy the property. Keep in mind that the project resembles a social media and bidding is strictly symbolic. There are no actual bank transactions happening, as it was out of scope for the project.</p><p>The project utilized Node and Typescript and had a React frontend, combined with a backend of Express microservices and NoSQL databases.</p><h3><span style="color: rgb(103, 58, 183)">Group project: CY2 AI Insights</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">The group project involved a company called CY2. They near-greenfield application that was about providing chatbots to educational institutes. The project had only been worked on by 1 group before, and in its initial state, it acted as a wrapper around ChatGPT and Sharepoint. The idea was that a user could use their app to combine the LLM of ChatGPT and a source of knowledge like Sharepoint in a “pipeline”. Afterwards, the pipeline could be integrated into a 3rd party system, for example a university website, to aid students looking for information. The project was built on Node and Typescript again, using React for the frontend, NestJS for the backend, a relational Postgres database and a vector Pinecone database for indexing documents from Sharepoint. Our group’s task was to provide insights regarding the usage of the pipelines<br> What is that pipeline’s traffic<br> What are the most asked questions<br> What are the most referenced documents<br>Just to name a few. Moreover, we also needed to implement system monitoring in the form of administrator logs. Users with the highest clearance could keep track of the system’s health trough different types of logs and be aware of any issues.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(63, 81, 181)">Self-assessment (so far)</span></h1><h3><span style="color: rgb(103, 58, 183)">Prof. standard</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">This learning outcome is related to taking responsibility when solving ICT issues.
