<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>For the group project, I and Nikolay Valchanov were tasked with adding monitoring to the CY2 FAQ application in the form of system logs. The idea behind the logs is that they are only accessible by a system administrator and show different events logged in the system.</p><p>The logs are of 3 types: Info, Warning and Error. Info logs are meant for debugging/developing purposes. Warning logs are events that may require attention within the system like sensitive actions, such as creation and deletion of tokens and failed authentication attempts. Error logs are meant for capturing mainly application runtime exceptions that would result in a 5xx HTTP code, so they can be investigated by a system admin.</p><p>The ERD for the system logs can be seen below:</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMjlxQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bf3a824bb5f74914a67590ce952911d462083ddc/image_2024-04-25_183657976.png" data-key="g7gomk5lyftrz28jzyguldtj19aj"><br></p><hr><p>The logs can be inspected, filtered and deleted as requested by the product owner. All of this ties into an interface that looks like the following:</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBM0JxQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8f95711268934e9b7b49eb9a81910de6ca307de2/image_2024-04-25_183902719.png" data-key="68yy0zn8u5lihus3dtwxzwbm46ic"><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBM3RxQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5736924fde9289d5f62571fd85b26515d8afc2af/image_2024-04-25_184752438.png" data-key="jdl01uoy0o62emtf324j16pnfvpr"></p> </body> </html>
