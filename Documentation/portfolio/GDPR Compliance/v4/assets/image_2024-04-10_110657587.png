In such a scenario, the user can be informed of the new terms and conditions in 2 ways:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An email is sent informing them that the terms and conditions have changed and they need to be accepted again.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the user tries to log in, they are notified of the new terms and conditions and they need to accept them. Otherwise they are locked out of their account.</p><p>In both scenarios, if the user does not wish to agree with the new terms and conditions,</p><p>they can take the action to delete their account from the platform.</p><p></p><h1>Optional user data</h1><p>Personal user data that is not crucial for the application to function is not required, unless the user wishes to provide it. In the case of this project, this information is the user’s address and phone number.</p><p>When creating an account, these fields are not marked as required. This is because they are personal information that can improve their experience on the platform, but it is not a part of the core functionalities.</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeWMzQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8a547d903c017ede83b3ab33570f6b4944a89694/image_2024-04-09_174716047.png" data-key="jl9qa7aeczz1qtftolqhgaibaoby"></p><p></p><p>This design is also reflected in the database models, where the address and phone fields can be empty.</p><p><img src="https://portfolio.drieam.app/api/public/v1/blobs/545ea1b8-b9c6-4fdf-9e1d-cab50ed05fbf/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeWczQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4eac326098e26b6898eb9dfea1fcd90d10ac92d9/image_2024-04-09_174724177.png" data-key="zbvtflqqjiyg96jujz9x8y04kxbx"></p><h1>Deleting the user’s account</h1><p>If the user chooses to do so, they can delete their account.
